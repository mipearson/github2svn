Uses webhook notifications from github to push github commits up to a SVN repository.
Written to get around our dependance on Jira Studio.

REQUIRES:
 * ruby
 * git
 * git-svn
 * json gem
 * sinatra gem
 * a rack-enabled stack (eg, passenger/nginx)
 
INSTALL:

For each repository you'd like to support:
 1. git svn clone in to ~/git, ensuring that the path matches that used by github.
    eg, http://github.com/mipearson/github2svn would be checked out to 
    ~/git/mipearson/github2svn
    
 2. Add the 'origin' remote to point to your github path, eg:
    git add remote origin git@github.com:mipearson/github2svn
